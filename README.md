Jquery-Oembed
============

This is a fork of the jquery-oembed located at http://code.google.com/p/jquery-oembed/.

Instead of using oohembed or other such services it tries to embed the object natively without using a third-party server.
This project while it will happily use native oembed services, it is not against using other types of embedding where ever possible.
